# Run From Mouse

You are a piece of cheese and you need to Run From Mouse. 
- Eat the cheese before Mouse does to prevent him from getting faster and stronger. 
- Don't get detected by Mouse when he's sniffing for cheese. 
- Once all cheese is gone, Mouse will chase you until he eats you or until you get through a hole in the wall.
